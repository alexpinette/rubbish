		Rubbish is a web-based version of the classic Balderdash board game, built for playing online 
		with friends and family. This project is a fork of 
		<a href="https://github.com/ivan-rivera/balderdash-web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="attention">
			ivan-rivera/balderdash-web
		</a>, 
		which was created by an independent developer who loves Balderdash. If you've stumbled upon this 
		web app, you're welcome to play it as much as you like and share it with your friends too.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have no intentions (or legal right) to put it behind a paywall, serve ads or monetize it in
		any way.

	<p>
		If you have any suggestions for how to make this app better, please let me know by submitting
		feedback after finishing a game (you'll be asked to do that) or by going into the "Contact"
		section in the footer.
	</p>

	<p>I sincerely hope you've enjoyed this game!</p>
